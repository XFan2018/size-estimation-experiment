TRAINING_INSTRUCTION = "Before conducting the experiment on the real dataset, you will see 10 cat images for training purpose. " \
                       "Please estimate the size of the cat in the image as a percentage of the whole image. " \
                       "For instance, if you think the object occupies half the image, enter '50'. indicating the cat occupies 50% of the whole image. " \
                       "Please provide your estimate to the nearest whole number. There are two types of " \

                       "want to use. If you choose 'grid', you can see grids on the image that split the image into 5% patches." \
                       "If you choose 'circle' you will see 5 circles on the image representing the 1%, 5%, 10%, 20%, and 50% area of the image. " \
                       "Press 'Enter' to run the training experiment. After each example, the correct size of the cat in the image will be displayed. " \
                       "If you are familiar with the experiment already. press 'esc' to skip the training part. "
